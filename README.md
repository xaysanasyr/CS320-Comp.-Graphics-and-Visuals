How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by following the structured guidelines, such as those outlined in the rubric, to ensure my designs meet the necessary requirements. I prioritize creativity and problem-solving by continuously considering potential improvements or new implementations. After planning, I focus on implementation, testing, and refining through trial and error until the solution is acceptable in my opinion.

How do I approach developing programs?
My approach to program development involves careful planning, incremental implementation, and continuous testing. I break down complex tasks into manageable steps and refine my code through multiple iterations. Debugging and testing play a crucial role in ensuring that the final product functions as intended.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Since my goals involve cybersecurity or data analytics, learning OpenGL and coding in this course helps develop problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and programming efficiency which are essential skills in both fields.
